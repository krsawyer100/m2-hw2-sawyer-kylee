        <p>Hello, my name is Kylee and I am a recent graduate of North Carolina State University's Design Studies undergraduate program. During my undergraduate studies, I decided to take a random coding basics class online to see if I would enjoy coding and the realm of web design. I immediately fell in love with coding and the design process of building a website and knew I wanted to pursue it as a career. I also discovered my passion for ADHD-Friendly design through my Capstone research paper.</p>
